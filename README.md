# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION
Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers into segments up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively. These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona.

#K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a method used for clustering analysis, especially in data mining and statistics. It aims to partition a set of observations into a number of clusters (k), resulting in the partitioning of the data into Voronoi cells.
K-means clustering uses “centroids”, K different randomly-initiated points in the data, and assigns every data point to the nearest centroid. After every point has been assigned, the centroid is moved to the average of all of the points assigned to it.
